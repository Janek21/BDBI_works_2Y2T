The exam submission will consist in one compressed directory. In this compressed directory you will include two directories: one named results and another named scratch. In the results directory you will include all the files I ask you during the different questions and a text file where you will answer the questions. The scratch directory will be the directory where you have done the exam, and it will contain all the files you have generated. 

Each question accounts for 1 point. Try to keep answers simple and direct. You can use your notes and materials of the classes if you want, you can also check biological databases. 

In this exercise we are working with a target protein for which we have its sequence but we don't know its structure or function. This is its sequence:

1) What is the function of this protein?
	
	$blastp -query target.fasta -db ~/Documents/databases/pdb_seq -out target_pdb.out
	Lowest E-value = First entries
	ID=2bod -> Search pdb
	Function = ENDOGLUCANASE E-2

2) What is the fold of this protein? 

	From previous exercise, first hit was 2bod, chain X -> SCOP database -> search for 2bod ?? -> 7 stranded beta/alpha barrel

3) Obtain a HMM for this protein in the PFAM database. Name this HMM 3.hmm.

	$hmmscan ~/Documents/databases/Pfam-A.hmm target.fasta > scan_target_PFAM.out
	
	Choose the first hit in scan_target_PFAM.out (Glyco_hydro_6)
	
	$hmmfetch ~/Documents/databases/Pfam-A.hmm Glyco_hydro_6 > 3.hmm

4) Use the HMM you just obtained to retrieve 4 sequences from the uniprot database. Then, align these 4 sequences and your target using the same HMM you used to get the sequences. Name the alignment 4.aln.

	$hmmsearch 3.hmm ~/Documents/databases/uniprot_sprot.fasta > MSA_3.out
	
	First 4 sequences (B0XWL3, Q4WFK4, A1DJQ7, P49075) (seq1-4) -> download from uniprot ->join all
	
	$cat seq*.fasta >> sequences.fasta
	
	$hmmalign 3.hmm sequences.fasta > MSA_ex4.sto
	$perl ~/Documents/databases/perl_scripts/aconvertMod2.pl -in h -out c <MSA_ex4.sto > 4.aln
	

5) Obtain 4 templates for your target. Indicate their corresponding PDB IDs. Should you use the whole PDB entry or just a part of it?

	PDB IDs to get templates are: 2bod, 1tml, 2bog, 2bof
	to get the you can use pymol 
		fetch 2bod 1tml 2bog 2bof

6) Superimpose the 4 templates you obtained in the previous question using pymol. Provide the RMSD value for all the superimpositions and save an image of the superimposition as 6.png.

	fetch 2bod 1tml 2bog 2bof
	remove resn hoh
	super 2bod, 1tml, object=aln6
	super 2bog, 1tml, object=aln6
	super 2bof, 1tml, object=aln6
	
	2bod-1tml RMSD = 2.298
	2bog-1tml RMSD = 2.300
	2bof-1tml RMSD = 2.295
	
	Menu> Draw/Ray >Ray >Save as. Save the render as 6.png
	
7) Your target is an enzyme. Find a template that contains a substrate molecule in its active site. Provide an image of the template you chose where the substrate can be seen and name the image 7.png.

	Many of the templates present what could be active sites, I decided to use 2bod.
	Select the residues that are separated from the rest on sequence display. Then sidebar> sele> color >blue. Then save the image
	
8) Analyze the template you selected in the previous question: identify 3 aminoacids that are making contacts with the substrate molecule. Provide 3 images (one for each aminoacid) where one of the aminoacids can be seen interacting with the substrate. Name the images active1.png, active2.png and active3.png.
	
	rename selection to substrate
	select nearby residues
		show sticks, byres all within 5 of subst
	Sidebar>2bod>hide>cartoon
	Select all shown molecules
	rename selection to active_site
	Sidebar>active_site>A>find>polar contacts>polar contacts to many atoms
	Look at connections to substrate, then select the residue and use sequence display to find residue name and position
	TYR-73, ALA-271, ASN-190
	
9) Make an structural model of the target sequence and name it 9.pdb. 

	Pymol? or modeller?

10) Analyze with prosa the model you generated in the previous question. To perform a reliable analysis, should you compare the analysis of your model with another structure? What structure is this?
