The exam submission will consist in one compressed directory. In this compressed directory you will include two directories: one named results and another named scratch. In the results directory you will include all the files I ask you during the different questions and a text file where you will answer the questions. The scratch directory will be the directory where you have done the exam, and it will contain all the files you have generated. 

Each question accounts for 1 point. Try to keep answers simple and direct. You can use your notes and materials of the classes if you want, you can also check biological databases. 

In this exercise we are working with a target protein for which we have its pdb but we don't know its sequence or function. The structure of this protein is stored in the file unknown.pdb.

1) Get the sequence corresponding to this structure and save it in a fasta file named 1.fa.

	$perl ~/Documents/databases/perl_scripts/PDBtoSplitChain.pl -i unknown.pdb -o 1
	
2) What is the fold of this protein? 
	
	$blastp -query 1.fa -db ~/bioinfo/databases/pdb_seq -out 1_pdb.out
	
	Get ID of first hit 2hdx, chain F -> search in SCOP -> F option -> SH2B

3) Obtain a HMM for this protein in the PFAM database. Name this HMM 3.hmm.

	$hmmscan ~/Documents/databases/Pfam-A.hmm 1.fa > scan_target_PFAM.out
	
	Choose same option as function, ideally the first option (SH2)
	
	$hmmfetch ~/Documents/databases/Pfam-A.hmm SH2 > 3.hmm

4) Use the HMM you just obtained to retrieve 4 sequences from the uniprot database. Then, align these 4 sequences and your target using the same HMM you used to get the sequences. Name the alignment 4.aln.

	$hmmsearch 3.hmm ~/Documents/databases/uniprot_sprot.fasta > MSA_3.out
	First 4 sequences (P29349, P41499, P35235, Q06124) (seq1-4) -> download from uniprot ->join all
		$cat seq*.fasta >>sequences.fasta
	Can be $clustalw sequences.fasta, better to use
	$hmmalign 3.hmm sequences.fasta > MSA_ex4.sto
	$perl ~/Documents/databases/perl_scripts/aconvertMod2.pl -in h -out c <MSA_ex4.sto > 4.aln
	

5) Find an homologous protein to our protein of interest with available structure. Superimpose both structures and provide the RMSD and an image of the superimposition named 5.png.

	RMSD=0.423
	5.png created
	

6) Generate an structure-based alignment from the superimposition you created in the previous exercise. Name this alignment 6.aln.

	save 6.aln, aln5

7) Analyze with prosa the structure of your protein of interest. To perform a reliable analysis, should you compare the analysis of your model with another structure? What structure could be this?

	The plot compares how good our structure is compared with the structures in the pdb. To compare it with another structure we could use prosa in another tab and load in the pdb structure, then look at their Z-scores and graphs to compare. We could use 2hdx.pdb

8) PDB entry 2k79 contains an interaction between two proteins. One of these two proteins is homologous to our protein of interest, could you identify what chain in the 2k79 entry is homologous to our protein of interest?

	Go to pymol
		fetch 2k79
		super 2k79, unknown , object=aln
	Top bar > Display > sequence mode > chain identifiers
	We can see that the homologous chain is chain B

9) Superimpose our protein of interest on top of the homologous chain of the 2k79 entry. Provide the RMSD of the superimposition and a picture of the superimposition and name it 9.png.
	
	super 2k79, unknown , object=aln
	RMSD = 1.531

10) Generate a new pdb file that only contains our protein of interest interacting with the non homologous chain in the 2k79 structure. Name it 10.pdb.

	Visualizing the alignment done on the previous exercise using the sequence chain identifier on pymol (activated on exercise 8), select chain A from 2k79 and remove it, then go to the sidebar, and remove the alignment (aln). Now fo to the top bar > File > Export Molecule > PDB options > Write HEADER... > Save. And save as 10.pdb
